        <h1>Condos & Townhomes in New Jersey</h1>
        
        <p>Shopping for condos and townhomes in New Jersey? I'm Christopher Burns with Century 21 Action Plus Realty, and I've helped tons of people find the perfect low-maintenance home in Monmouth County, Ocean County, and Middlesex County. There's something really freeing about coming home and not worrying about mowing the lawn or fixing the roof yourself.</p>

        <p>I'll never forget showing a townhome in Manalapan to a couple who just retired. The wife walked onto the deck, looked at the community pool, and said "I'm done raking leaves for the rest of my life." They made an offer that afternoon. That's the appeal of condo and townhome living - you get to actually enjoy your weekends instead of working on yard stuff.</p>

        <h2>Why People Love Condos and Townhomes</h2>

        <p>Look, single-family homes are great if you want space and total control. But condos and townhomes solve a lot of problems that people don't even realize they have until they make the switch.</p>

        <p>No more worrying about the roof leaking. No more paying thousands to replace the siding. Snow removal? Someone else handles it. The HOA fee covers all that exterior maintenance stuff. Yeah, you're paying a fee every month, but you're not dealing with surprise $8,000 roof bills either.</p>

        <p>I had a client who was spending every weekend doing yard work at his old house. Bought a townhome in Marlboro and now he actually has time to golf. That's worth something, you know?</p>

        <h3>Who Should Buy a Condo or Townhome</h3>

        <p>First-time buyers love them because they're usually cheaper than single-family homes. Young professionals who travel alot appreciate not worrying about maintenance. Empty nesters are downsizing from big houses. Retirees want simplicity.</p>

        <p>But here's the thing - you gotta be okay with shared walls and HOA rules. If you hate the idea of neighbors or following community guidelines, this probably isn't for you. Be honest with yourself about what kind of person you are.</p>

        <h2>What Condos and Townhomes Actually Cost Around Here</h2>

        <p>Prices vary like crazy depending on where you look and what you want. In Monmouth County, you might find older condos starting around $250,000, but nicer townhomes can run $400,000 to $600,000 easy. Ocean County tends to be a bit cheaper - good options in the $200,000-$400,000 range.</p>

        <p>Then you've got your HOA fees on top of the mortgage. Could be $200 a month, could be $600 a month. Depends on what amenities the community has and how much they're covering. Always ask what the fee includes before you get too excited about a low purchase price.</p>

        <p>Had a buyer last year almost make an offer on a cheap condo in Brick. Then we found out the HOA fee was $550 a month and the building needed a new roof next year - everyone was getting hit with a $15,000 special assesment. We kept looking and found her something way better.</p>

        <h3>HOA Fees - What You're Really Paying For</h3>

        <p>This confuses people all the time. You're paying this monthly fee, so what are you actually getting?</p>

        <p>Usually it covers: exterior maintenance, landscaping, snow removal, trash pickup, common area upkeep, insurance on the building exterior, sometimes water and sewer. Nice communities might have a pool, gym, clubhouse - that's all included too.</p>

        <p>What it doesn't cover: your mortgage, property taxes, interior repairs, your personal utilities, your own condo insurance (you still need that). People forget about those costs sometimes.</p>

        <p>The key is looking at the total monthly payment - mortgage plus HOA fee plus taxes. That's your real number. A $300,000 condo with a $400 HOA fee might cost you more per month than a $350,000 townhome with a $200 fee.</p>

        <h2>Best Places for Condos and Townhomes in New Jersey</h2>

        <p>I've sold units all over these three counties. Here's where I think you get the best value and quality of life.</p>

        <h3>Monmouth County Options</h3>

        <p>Marlboro has some really nice townhome communities. Great schools if you've got kids, close to shopping, good highway access for commuting. Prices run $400k-$550k usually. The HOA fees are reasonable and the communities are well maintained.</p>

        <p>Freehold is another solid choice. Mix of condos and townhomes at different price points. You can still find decent condos under $300k if you look around. The downtown area has gotten way better the last few years with new restaurants and shops.</p>

        <p>Holmdel has higher-end options if you've got more budget. We're talking $500k+ but you're getting top schools and really nice amenities. Just sold a townhome there to a couple moving from Brooklyn - they couldn't believe how much space they got compared to the city.</p>

        <p>Shore towns like Long Branch have condo buildings right near the beach. These are pricey though - starting around $400k for smaller units. But if you want to walk to the ocean, that's what it costs. Some people rent these out in summer to help with the mortgage.</p>

        <h3>Ocean County Picks</h3>

        <p>Brick has tons of condos and townhomes at good prices. You can find 2-bedroom condos starting around $200k, townhomes in the $300k-$400k range. Not the fanciest area but good value for your money and close to the shore.</p>

        <p>Toms River is similar - lots of options, affordable prices, family-friendly. The 55+ communities here are really popular with retirees. They've got all the amenities and social activities, plus age restrictions mean it stays quiet.</p>

        <p>Lacey Township has some newer townhome developments that are really nice. Little further from the beach but you get more space for your money. Good option if you're working in the area and want something modern.</p>

        <h3>Middlesex County Communities</h3>

        <p>Monroe Township where I live has great townhome communities. Mix of all ages, good schools, convenient location. Prices run $350k-$500k depending on size and age of the unit. The newer sections have really nice amenities.</p>

        <p>East Brunswick has solid options too. Close to everything, good highway access to NYC if you're commuting. Condos start around $250k, townhomes around $350k and up. The school district is really good which helps with resale value.</p>

        <p>Old Bridge gives you affordable options with decent commuting access. Not as fancy as some areas but you get more for your money. Good starter condos under $250k if you look around.</p>

        <h2>Condo vs Townhome - What's the Difference</h2>

        <p>People ask me this all the time. Here's the simple version:</p>

        <p>Condos are usually in buildings. You own the interior of your unit, the HOA owns everything else. Might be high-rise buildings, garden-style buildings, whatever. You're sharing walls, floors, and ceilings with neighbors.</p>

        <p>Townhomes are attached houses. You own the structure and usually a small yard or patio. Sharing walls with neighbors on the sides but not above or below. Feels more like a house, less like an apartment.</p>

        <p>Townhomes usually have higher HOA fees because there's more to maintain. But you get more space and privacy. Condos are cheaper but you hear your neighbors more. Pick what works for your lifestyle and budget.</p>

        <h3>The HOA Rules Thing</h3>

        <p>Every community has rules. Some are chill, some are super strict. You gotta read the docs before buying.</p>

        <p>Common rules: no loud parties, keep your patio clean, no parking in fire lanes, follow trash schedule. Pretty reasonable stuff.</p>

        <p>Annoying rules some places have: can't grill on your deck, no holiday decorations after certain dates, have to get approval to paint your front door, no pets over 25 pounds. This stuff drives people crazy if they don't know about it upfront.</p>

        <p>I always tell buyers to read the HOA documents during your inspection period. If you see rules you can't live with, walk away. Not worth buying into a community where you'll be miserable.</p>

        <h2>What to Look For When Buying</h2>

        <p>After helping people buy condos and townhomes for years, here's what really matters.</p>

        <h3>Check the HOA Finances</h3>

        <p>This is huge. You want an HOA with money in the bank for repairs and emergencies. Ask to see their budget and reserve fund.</p>

        <p>Red flags: HOA hasn't raised fees in 10 years (means they're probably underfunded), reserve fund is really low, lots of special assessments recently, they're involved in lawsuits. All bad signs.</p>

        <p>Good signs: healthy reserve fund, regular maintenance on schedule, fees adjusted regularly to keep up with costs, financially stable.</p>

        <p>Had a buyer almost purchase in a building where the HOA had $50,000 in reserves but needed a $500,000 roof replacement. That would've been a huge special assessment for everyone. We found out during due diligence and she backed out.</p>

        <h3>Age and Condition Matter</h3>

        <p>Newer buildings mean less maintenance issues short-term. But you're paying more upfront. Older buildings can be great deals but might need work soon.</p>

        <p>Things to check: roof age, siding condition, common areas upkeep, parking lot condition. If stuff looks run down, that's gonna be your problem soon through HOA fees or assessments.</p>

        <p>Get a good inspection even on condos. They can check your unit for problems. The HOA should have inspection reports for the whole building too - ask to see them.</p>

        <h3>Location Within the Community</h3>

        <p>Not all units are created equal. Corner units are usually quieter. Top floor means no one stomping above you. Ground floor means easier access but you hear people walking by.</p>

        <p>Near the pool? Could be loud in summer. Near the entrance? More traffic noise. Backing to woods? More privacy but maybe bugs. Think about what matters to you.</p>

        <p>Parking situation matters too. Do you get your own spot? Is it covered? Guest parking available? These things affect your daily life.</p>

        <h2>The Buying Process for Condos and Townhomes</h2>

        <p>Pretty similar to buying a house, with a few extra steps because of the HOA.</p>

        <h3>Get Pre-Approved</h3>

        <p>Same as buying any home - get pre-approved for a mortgage first. Lenders look at the HOA fees when calculating what you can afford. A $300,000 condo with $400 HOA fees is treated differently than a $300,000 house with no HOA.</p>

        <p>Some lenders won't finance in certain buildings if the HOA is in bad shape financially. Better to know that upfront before you fall in love with a place.</p>

        <h3>Make Your Offer</h3>

        <p>Once you find something you like, we put together an offer. Usually include contingencies for inspection and HOA document review. That review period is when you read all the HOA stuff and can back out if you don't like what you see.</p>

        <p>Condos and townhomes can move fast in good communities. Be ready to make decisions quick if you're in a competitive area.</p>

        <h3>Do Your Homework</h3>

        <p>Get the HOA documents and actually read them. Or at least read the important parts. Check the rules, the budget, the meeting minutes from the last year. See what issues keep coming up.</p>

        <p>Talk to neighbors if you can. Ask what they like and don't like about living there. People are usually pretty honest if you just ask.</p>

        <h3>Close and Move In</h3>

        <p>Closing is the same process - sign papers, transfer money, get keys. Then you're part of the HOA and gotta follow their rules. Most communities have welcome packets with all the info you need.</p>
