        <h1>Single-Family Homes in New Jersey</h1>
        
        <p>Looking for a single-family home in New Jersey? I'm Christopher Burns with Century 21 Action Plus Realty, and I've been helping families find their perfect house in Monmouth County, Ocean County, and Middlesex County for years now. There's something really special about that moment when a family walks into a house and just knows - this is the one.</p>

        <p>Last month, I showed a house in Freehold to a young couple with two kids. The husband wasn't even planning to make an offer that day, but then his daughter ran into the backyard and yelled "Dad, we can get a dog now!" That sealed the deal right there. Single-family homes give you that kind of space and freedom you just don't get anywhere else.</p>

        <h2>Why Single-Family Homes Are Still What Everyone Wants</h2>

        <p>Look, I get it - condos and townhomes have their perks. No lawn to mow, someone else fixes the roof when it leaks. But here's the thing: when you own a single-family home, it's really yours. You want to paint the kitchen bright yellow? Go for it. Want to build a shed or put in a pool? Nobody's gonna stop you or make you fill out forms with the HOA.</p>

        <p>In New Jersey, single-family homes make up most of what's out there. That's not by accident. People here value their space, their privacy, and being able to do what they want with their property. I had a client in Marlboro who bought a house just because he wanted to work on cars in the garage. Try doing that in a condo - your neighbors would go crazy.</p>

        <h2>What Houses Really Cost Around Here</h2>

        <p>Okay, let's talk money because I know that's what you're thinking about. The median price for a single-family home in Monmouth County is running around $585,000 right now. Ocean County is a bit more affordable at about $475,000. Middlesex County sits somewhere in the middle around $520,000.</p>

        <p>But here's what those numbers don't tell you: what you get for your money changes big time depending on where you look. A $450,000 house in Brick might get you 2,000 square feet with a nice yard. That same money in Red Bank? You're looking at a much smaller place, but you're walking distance to all the downtown restaurants and shops.</p>

        <p>I always tell people - don't just look at the price tag. Think about what you're actually getting and what matters to your family. Had a couple from Pennsylvania who almost bought in a cheaper area, then realized they'd be spending 2 hours a day commuting. We found them something closer to work for a bit more money, and they're way happier now.</p>

        <h3>Property Taxes - Yeah, They're High</h3>

        <p>I'm not gonna sugarcoat this: New Jersey has high property taxes. Like, really high. On a $500,000 home, you might pay anywhere from $8,000 to $14,000 a year depending on what town you pick. That's just reality here.</p>

        <p>But here's what I tell people - you're paying for something. Good schools, clean streets, solid services. Towns like Holmdel or Colts Neck have property taxes that make your eyes water, but their schools are some of the best in the whole country. If you've got kids, that matters a lot.</p>

        <h2>Finding the Right Neighborhood for Your Family</h2>

        <p>This is where having a local agent who actually knows the area makes a huge difference. I grew up in New Jersey and I've been selling houses here for years. I know which towns have the best little league programs, which ones have bad traffic problems, and which neighborhoods are about to see some new development.</p>

        <h3>Monmouth County Favorites</h3>

        <p>Manalapan has gotten really popular with families the last few years. Great schools, newer houses, and you're close to highways for getting around. Prices are pretty reasonable compared to some of the shore towns. I just helped a family find a 4-bedroom colonial there for $575,000 - couldn't have gotten that in Rumson for under a million bucks.</p>

        <p>Holmdel is another gem. More established neighborhood feel, great school district, and you've still got some older homes with real character. If you like mature trees and that "we've been here forever" vibe, Holmdel delivers. Just be ready for those property taxes I mentioned.</p>

        <p>For shore living, Manasquan and Sea Girt are where you want to be if you can swing it. We're talking $800k on up, but you're getting beach town charm with good year-round communities. Not just summer rental chaos.</p>

        <h3>Ocean County Options</h3>

        <p>Brick and Toms River give you way more house for your money. You can still find decent single-family homes in the $400k range, which is pretty good these days. The schools aren't quite as highly ranked as some Monmouth County districts, but they're solid and the community is really strong.</p>

        <p>Jackson has totally blown up recently. Young families love it because you get space - we're talking half-acre lots in some neighborhoods. Plus you're close to Six Flags if you've got kids who like rollercoasters. The downside? Traffic on Route 571 can be pretty rough during rush hour.</p>

        <p>Point Pleasant is awesome if you want shore access without paying full shore prices. You're a bike ride from the beach, good downtown area with shops and restaurants, and the schools are pretty good too. Homes here run $500-700k depending on how close to the water you want to be.</p>

        <h3>Middlesex County Picks</h3>

        <p>Monroe Township is where I actually live, so I might be biased, but it's a great place for families. Good mix of ages, solid schools, and you're central to everything. The homes here range from $400k to $700k depending on which neighborhood you pick.</p>

        <p>Old Bridge gives you suburban living with NYC access if you need it. Lots of families who commute to the city choose here because you get more space than you would living closer in. The train station makes it doable, even if the commute isn't exactly fun.</p>

        <h2>What to Actually Look For in a House</h2>

        <p>After helping hundreds of families buy homes, I've seen what works and what doesn't. Here's my honest take on what really matters.</p>

        <h3>Lot Size and Your Yard</h3>

        <p>Don't just look at how big the house is. The yard matters too. A quarter-acre lot is pretty standard around here, but you'll find everything from tiny yards to half-acre properties.</p>

        <p>Think about what you'll actually use the yard for. Got dogs? You want some space and hopefully a fence or at least room to put one up. Kids who play sports? Bigger is definitely better. Just want a small garden and a place to grill? Quarter acre is plenty.</p>

        <p>One mistake I see people make all the time is buying the biggest yard they can afford, then realizing they hate mowing and all the maintenance. Be realistic about what you're willing to take care of on weekends.</p>

        <h3>School Districts Matter Even If You Don't Have Kids</h3>

        <p>Even if you don't have kids right now, this matters. Houses in top school districts hold their value way better. When it's time to sell down the road, you'll have an easier time and probably get more money.</p>

        <p>You can check ratings online, but also talk to actual parents in the district. I can connect you with people in any area you're looking at. Sometimes the ratings don't tell you the whole story - a school might have lower test scores because they have really strong special education programs, which is actually a good thing.</p>

        <h3>How Old Is the House</h3>

        <p>New Jersey has everything from brand new construction to houses from the 1800s. Each has good stuff and bad stuff.</p>

        <p>Newer homes (built in the last 20 years) usually mean less work right away. The furnace and AC are modern, insulation is better, and everything is up to current building codes. But you pay more per square foot, and sometimes the neighborhoods don't have much character yet.</p>

        <p>Older homes have charm, big trees, and often bigger lots. But you might need a new roof soon, updated electrical work, or other stuff. I always recommend getting a really thorough inspection on homes over 30 years old. Budget for some surprises.</p>

        <p>The sweet spot? Homes from the 1980s or 90s that have been taken care of. Old enough that you're not paying the new construction premium, new enough that you're probably not looking at major problems anytime soon.</p>

        <h2>How Buying a House Actually Works</h2>

        <p>Let me walk you through this for real, not the cleaned up version you see on those house hunting TV shows.</p>

        <h3>Get Pre-Approved First</h3>

        <p>Don't even start looking at houses until you're pre-approved for a mortgage. I can't show you homes if I don't know what you can actually afford, and sellers won't take your offer seriously without a pre-approval letter anyway.</p>

        <p>This isn't the same as pre-qualification where they just ask you some questions. Pre-approval means a lender has actually looked at your financials and said yes to a specific amount. Takes a few days and you'll need to provide tax returns, pay stubs, bank statements - all that stuff.</p>

        <p>I work with several local lenders who know the New Jersey market really well. They close on time, which matters way more than you'd think. Had a deal almost fall apart last year because the buyer's out-of-state lender couldn't get their act together.</p>

        <h3>The House Hunt</h3>

        <p>This is the fun part. We'll set up searches based on what you want, and I'll send you new listings as soon as they hit the market. Good houses go fast around here, so you gotta be ready to move quick.</p>

        <p>I usually recommend seeing at least 10-15 houses before making an offer. Helps you calibrate what's out there and what you really want. Some people know right away, others need to see more options. No rush - this is probably the biggest purchase of your life.</p>

        <h3>Making Your Offer</h3>

        <p>Once you find the one, we put together an offer. In this market, you're often competing with other buyers. I'll help you figure out a price that's competitive but not crazy. Sometimes we include an escalation clause that says you'll beat other offers up to a certain amount.</p>

        <p>We also negotiate things like inspection contingencies, closing dates, and what stays with the house. That fancy chandelier? Sometimes it's included, sometimes it's not. Gotta spell it all out.</p>

        <h3>Inspection Time</h3>

        <p>This is where we find out what's actually wrong with the house. I always recommend getting a full inspection, even on new construction. Inspectors find stuff - trust me on that.</p>

        <p>If they find big problems, we can negotiate with the seller to fix them, give you money off the price, or sometimes you might walk away if it's really bad. Had an inspection last year find major foundation issues. We walked. Better to lose your inspection fee than buy someone else's nightmare.</p>

        <h3>Closing Day</h3>

        <p>This is when you sign about a million papers and get the keys. Usually happens at a title company office. Takes about an hour of signing, then the house is yours. Bring a checkbook because you'll need to pay closing costs and your down payment.</p>

        <p>I'll be there with you to make sure everything goes smooth. Sometimes last-minute problems pop up, but that's why you have an agent who knows what they're doing.</p>
